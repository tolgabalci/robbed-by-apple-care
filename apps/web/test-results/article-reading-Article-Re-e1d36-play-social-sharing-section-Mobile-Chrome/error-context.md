As someone who paid extra for Apple's premium support service, I expected the process to be straightforward: report the issue, get it diagnosed, and receive a repair or replacement."
        - paragraph [ref=e42]: What followed was a masterclass in corporate gaslighting, bureaucratic incompetence, and customer service failure that would make Kafka proud.
