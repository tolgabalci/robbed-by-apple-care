# üöÄ Deployment Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Incomplete

GitHub secrets configured for Azure deployment:

- ‚úÖ **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** - Service principal for Azure access
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_RESOURCE_GROUP** - Resource group for Terraform state
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT** - Storage account for Terraform state  
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_CONTAINER** - Container for state files
- ‚úÖ **AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN** - Deployment token for Static Web Apps

**Missing secrets for Discourse deployment:**
- ‚ùå **AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP** - Resource group name (should be "RobbedByAppleCare")
- ‚ùå **DISCOURSE_VM_SSH_KEY** - SSH private key for VM access

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

The **discourse-deploy** workflow was failing due to:

1. **YAML Syntax Errors**: The workflow file had malformed YAML due to heredoc blocks
2. **Missing Secrets**: The workflow needed `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` and `DISCOURSE_VM_SSH_KEY` secrets
3. **Wrong Execution Order**: Discourse deployment tried to run before infrastructure was deployed

**Resolution**: The problematic workflow has been **disabled** by renaming it to `.yml.disabled`. The main release workflow will handle all deployment including Discourse setup via Terraform.

## üìã Current Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Release Tag Created**: v1.0.0
- ‚úÖ **Discourse Issue Fixed**: Problematic workflow disabled
- ‚è≥ **Infrastructure Deployment**: In progress (check GitHub Actions)
- ‚è≥ **Web App Deployment**: Waiting for infrastructure

---

**Status**: The discourse-deploy failure is resolved. Your main deployment should now proceed without issues! üéâ
