# üöÄ Deployment Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Incomplete

GitHub secrets configured for Azure deployment:

- ‚úÖ **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** - Service principal for Azure access
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_RESOURCE_GROUP** - Resource group for Terraform state
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT** - Storage account for Terraform state  
- ‚úÖ **TF_STATE_CONTAINER** - Container for state files
- ‚úÖ **AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN** - Deployment token for Static Web Apps

**Missing secrets for Discourse deployment:**
- ‚ùå **AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP** - Resource group name (should be "RobbedByAppleCare")
- ‚ùå **DISCOURSE_VM_SSH_KEY** - SSH private key for VM access

## üîß Issue Identified

The **discourse-deploy** workflow failed because:

1. **Missing Secrets**: The workflow needs `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` and `DISCOURSE_VM_SSH_KEY` secrets
2. **Wrong Execution Order**: Discourse deployment tried to run before infrastructure was deployed
3. **VM Not Created**: The workflow tried to connect to a VM that doesn't exist yet

## üéØ Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Missing Secrets (Quick Fix)

Add these GitHub secrets manually:

1. **AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP**: `RobbedByAppleCare`
2. **DISCOURSE_VM_SSH_KEY**: Generate SSH key pair and add private key

### Option 2: Disable Discourse Workflow (Recommended)

Since the main infrastructure deployment will handle Discourse setup via Terraform, we can:

1. Disable the discourse-deploy workflow temporarily
2. Let the main release workflow handle everything
3. Re-enable discourse-deploy later for configuration updates

## üìã Current Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Release Tag Created**: v1.0.0
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Infrastructure Deployment**: In progress (check GitHub Actions)
- ‚ùå **Discourse Deployment**: Failed (missing secrets)
- ‚è≥ **Web App Deployment**: Waiting for infrastructure

**Recommendation**: Let the main release workflow complete first, then address Discourse configuration separately.
