# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RobbedByAppleCare is a single-purpose website designed to host one long-form complaint article about AppleCare with an embedded Discourse forum for community discussion. The project consists of a static single-page application hosted on Azure with a custom domain (RobbedByAppleCare.com), featuring a main site at www.robbedbyapplecare.com and a Discourse forum at forum.robbedbyapplecare.com. The forum is embedded directly beneath the article content to create a Reddit-style discussion experience.

## Requirements
